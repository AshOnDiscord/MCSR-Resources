This overview assumes you are using a default layout and will prefer ones easier to type on a default layout:
- Easy to press with your left hand
- Easy to press at once
	- Double taps are hence disadvantaged
- etc

**Info:**
`<clear>` can be either `<ctrl+backspace>` or reopening
if `backspace` is hard to hit (esp so for those who don't remap their keyboard (i'd recommend something like `backtick` since its never used in search crafting nor really normal non-markdown/coding typing and very easy to reach), you may want to just reopen and retype the full sequence, many should be quick to do so either way
# Overworld
Iron Pick, Iron/Stone Axe, Bucket, Shovel, Door, Boat, Shears, Flint & Steel

`ag`/`-` - tools
`b` - boat, doors, bucket, boots (a-lot of  junk)
- `uc` - boat, doors, bucket / `j` - boats, doors
- `ts` - boots / `et` - armor + bucket
Flint & Steel - just click, always first row & only one craft (tbh i would just normal craft)

## Recommended Order
`ag` - tools
choose your poison between `b`, `j` + `et`

# Nether
Bed (Wool), Respawn Anchor, Glowstone, Nether Bricks
Iron Ingots + Iron Axe/Sword, Fishing Rod
Blaze Powder, Eye of Ender
Bow/Crossbow (Tripwires)

`ot` - ingots, golden carrots
- recommended over other golden carrot crafts as you can craft left over gold back to ingots for tools
	- you can start with all into nuggets, craft carrots, excess into ignots
`ro` - iron ingots, iron tools, golden carrots
- `3`/`x` - iron axe
- `4`/`sw` - sword
`w` - wool, glowstone [2x2]
`re` - bed, anchor, tripwires
- `wn` - bed, anchor (less junk but harder to type)
`r<space>` - nether bricks [join with `r*`]
`rr` - golden carrots [join with other `r*`]
`de` - golden apples (and carrots?)
- `pp`/`ap` - golden apples (much less junk but harder to type)
`ow` - bow, crossbow
- `sb` - crossbow
`g<space>` - fishing rod
`y` - eyes of ender [2x2]

weird random crafts

`e` [2x2]
- blaze powder, eye of ender, wool, glowstone, netherbricks
blocks tab [2x2]
- wool, glowstone, netherbricks
---
**Tbh for a-lot of the 2x2-able ones, you don't really need to filter more, there's not much possible 2x2 junk**

## Recommended Order:
[Open Inv]
[Click Blocks Tab]
Craft Wool, Glowstone, Netherbrick
- Toss 1 string for bow/crossbow, toss another for fishing rod if desired
[Close Inv, Open Table]
`re` - craft beds, anchors
`<backspace>o` - craft iron ingots, iron axe/sword, golden carrots
- craft fishing rod if desired
You can blaze bed first here
`<clear>ow` - bow
- or click weapons table
If no apples/gold, you're done, else
`<clear>de` - golden apples
